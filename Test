    <h1>
      who am i?
    </h1>
    <p>
      A final year student at university college dublin, who enjoys whitewater kayaking, judo, snowsports, tinkering with my arch linux setup, and chess. I believe strongly in the adoption of FOSS. I prefer simplicity and functionality over flash and bloat (proud member of the <a href="https://512kb.club">512kb club</a> with this site being 5.08kb uncompressed).
    </p>
    <h2>
      things that interest me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I post what i'm working on on <a href=
      "https://github.com/conorhk">my github</a>.
      I want to move to a FOSS platform over Microsoft's closed source product though, so this will change to Sourcehut or some other alternative soon when I get a chance to migrate.
